### Data Preparation

- **Use clear column names** (like "Customer Name" instead of "Cust1")
- **Make sure dates are in a consistent format**
- **Check for missing data** and fill it in if possible

### Asking AI Questions
- **Be specific**: "Top 10 products by revenue" is better than "best products"
- **Use business terms**: "sales", "revenue", "customers", "profit"
- **Ask follow-up questions**: "Now show me the trends for those products"
- **Try different angles**: "What's the worst performing region?"

### Working with Multiple Tables
- **Connect related tables** using common columns (like customer ID)
- **Start simple** with one table, then add relationships
- **Use the ER diagram** to understand your data structure
- **Test relationships** by asking questions that span multiple tables
